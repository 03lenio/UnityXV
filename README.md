# UnityXV

_Last chatbot I'm making I promise_

---

UnityXV is an experimental chatbot project built primarily in Python, with supporting JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the user interface. This project is designed as a proof-of-concept for conversational AI and chatbot interaction, serving both as a learning tool and a fun demonstration of modern chatbot capabilities.

## Features

- **Conversational AI:** Engage in dynamic conversations powered by a custom Python backend.
- **Web-based UI:** Responsive interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- **Extensible:** Designed for learning, experimentation, and further development.
- **Modular Structure:** Easily modify or extend components for new features.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (88.8%): Backend logic, API, and core chatbot brain.
- **JavaScript** (7.6%): Front-end interactivity.
- **HTML** (2.2%): Markup for the user interface.
- **CSS** (1.4%): Styling for a clean and modern look.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- (Optional) Node.js (for front-end development)
